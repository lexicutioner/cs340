How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The most important thing to do is to make sure that you add comments to the sections of your code that perform a function. You dont have to comment on every single line, but having these comments by section will make it to where people cafn understand what it is you were trying to perform with that code, and may help them if they use your code as a base and need to make edits. It was nice having the code I wrote previously and knowing exactly where to look when I was implementing the code I used in project one for project two. I may be able to use this as a bseline for my own future projects in which I may need to make a database.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The first thing I like to do is take whatever issue I'm having and research it thoroughly. I know for a fact that any problem I have isn't unique to me, and that other people are likely experiencing or have experienced in the past the same thing. I really like to use stack overflow when I find myself in a pinch, and a lot of times someone has already asked the question! I'd say it was great that thge requirements were listed out to me clearly by the grazioso salvare company because it made it easier for me to understand exactly what I needed to do.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

We try to figure out all of the requirements from the customer in order to make sure that we fulfill their needs. Our job is to creaste whatedver program it is that the customer requests from us within reason, and give them appropriate timelines on how long it would take for us to realistically finish whatever program we are creating for them. I would try to automate the system and add buttoms so it is much easier for the customer to use. I know that mongodb looks very confusing and I would hate to remove that ease of access for the customer.
